TDD - Test Driven Development
	Write tests before writing code
	
	"red-green" testing 
		
		Test fail before code is written

Why TDD	
		
	More efficient
		
		Re run tests "for free" after changes
		
	Better Code

		Better organished(plan before you code)
		
		More testable(no rewriting code for tests)
		
		Fewer bug(caught sooner,refression)
		
		Great code coverage
		
Enzyme has better toolkit

	Search through DOM
		
		jquery style selector
		
	Simulate simple events

	
Shallow Rendering

	Render components only one level deep

	Render parent, but use placeholder for children

	
Types of Tests

	Unit test
	
		Test one piece of code(usually one function)
		
	Integration test	
	
		How multiple unit work together
		
	Acceptance/ End to End (E2E) Tests

		How a user would interact with app
		
Testing goal :

	1: Ease of maintaince of test	

	2: Easy diagnosis of failing test

Removing data-test attributes

	npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-react-remove-properties
	
	npm run eject (so that we can update babel config)
	
	Update babel config(either with package.json or with other ways .babelrc)
	
	create production build
	
	Data-test attrubute has gone.
